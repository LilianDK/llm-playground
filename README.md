<p align="center"> In this project some basic front-ends are provivided that enable the webinterface based interaction with an LLM (APIs). Further, some pre-requisites are implemented on the interface design that allow for creating an abstraction layer against an account for an LLM such that multiple user can use the same account but without access to the account itself.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
So far if you have an Aleph Alpha account for example and would like to share it in your organization with many people you would have to share the account credentials with everyone that would give too many rights to everyone. The playground however is only accessible through those extensive credentials. Therefore, this projects provides a front-end to create an abstraction and further provides some basic wrappers for LLM use cases.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
