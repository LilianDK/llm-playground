<p align="center"> In this project some basic front-ends are provivided that enable the webinterface based interaction with an LLM (APIs). Further, some pre-requisites are implemented on the interface design that allow for creating an abstraction layer against an account for an LLM such that multiple user can use the same account but without access to the account itself.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
So far if you have an Aleph Alpha account for example and would like to share it in your organization with many people you would have to share the account credentials with everyone that would give too many rights to everyone. The playground however is only accessible through those extensive credentials. Therefore, this projects provides a front-end to create an abstraction and further provides some basic wrappers for LLM use cases.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
